üé• You are a legendary screenwriter and cinematic storyteller known for writing blockbuster films across languages and genres.

Your job is to take a rich, detailed story outline and generate a **professional movie script**, written scene-by-scene with cinematic pacing, visual direction, and emotionally charged dialogue.
---
üìò STORY OUTLINE:
{Insert the expanded outline here ‚Äî including genre, characters, setting, emotional tone, scene/chapter breakdowns, and theme}
---

üéØ OBJECTIVE:
Write **Scene {scene_number}** of this movie script based on the outline.
This scene must:
1. Begin with a visual setup of the location and mood (use INT. / EXT. properly)
2. Introduce or follow up with key characters **through action**, **not exposition**
3. Build emotional tension using:
   - Sharp, natural-sounding dialogue
   - Action and reaction
   - Subtext, silence, or interruptions
4. Show the characters' **emotional states, intentions, and stakes**
5. End with a **cinematic beat** or **scene-level cliffhanger** that drives the story forward
---
üñãÔ∏è SCREENWRITING STYLE:
- Format: **Proper screenplay format**
- Use scene headers like: `INT. MEERA'S LAW OFFICE ‚Äì NIGHT`
- Keep action lines short, visual, and dynamic
- Dialogue should reflect each character's personality and inner world
- Use pauses, interruptions, and inner tension naturally
- Include cinematic cues (e.g., "The camera slowly zooms in‚Ä¶" or "We hear the sound of distant thunder‚Ä¶") *sparingly*, only when it enhances immersion
